# Ombrace
iOS and watchOS app built with Xcode that enables users to reconnect with their bodies and view themselves with kindness.  
It integrates Swift’s **Natural Language Framework** to enhance the user experience through mindful reflections and personalized guidance.

Through **guided exercises**, **body awareness practices**, and **mindful reflections**, users develop a healthier, more balanced relationship with their bodies—at their own pace, without pressure or judgment.

The app currently includes two session types: **Guided Session** and **Your Session**, to test different user flows and provide flexibility based on individual preferences.
